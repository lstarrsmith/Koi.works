# Koi

I built a landing page and lean MVP to test a business idea to help middle-aged men and women motivate stay active. My mother and her friends are beginning to see serious health costs result from inconsistent activity, so I came up with this idea as a possible solution.

Users form small, local groups and complete video workouts together in a group member's home or a public space. The focus, from a business perspective, is on the social nature of these groups, as I'm trying to remove any intimidating factors while instilling accountability. And I'm trying to keep it attainable by limiting the "committment" to 3 months at a time.


## Technical specs

The splash page uses CSS animations, and the prototype was built in Ruby on Rails with Backbone.js/ React.js. It includes a chat application built with Firebase, and there is a robust admin section for updating user information, groups, and responding to invitation requests.

## Soon to be added

* Improve animation/ content on survey
* Responsiveness
* Refactoring of Backbone/ React 
* Additional security features
* Scheduling application for groups
